# Notice - Deprecated

This plugin fulfilled my needs for a while, but in the time since it was first released there are newer and more feature complete plugins around, and with more active maintainers.

I now recommend using [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) as it has already solved a few of the issues that were opened for this plugin. Cheers!

## Features

A simple plugin to support the highlighting of .vue files. So far tested with JavaScript, Coffeescript, and HTML.

## Install

Place the following snippet into your settings file.

```
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.vue": "vue"
  }
}
```
